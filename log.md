# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made solid headway on two Airtable custom apps:
1. A big one that I'm creating for a client
1. My first custom app that I'm planning on publishing for sale. Spawned by a request from another Airtable user, this app takes an existing Airtable app to a whole new level.

**Total coding time today**: 3.5 hours

**Thoughts**: When I first started the personal custom app about a year ago, I was still pretty green in React. I'm a lot more comfortable with it now and really enjoy the development process, even when things don't work quite like I expect. There are bits of my original code that I'm able to salvage, but a good chunk of it will likely be scrapped.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately I can't share details about the client app, but I'll see if I can share some screenshots once it's finished. I'll share more about the other app once it's ready to publish.

### Day 2: February 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Good progress on my client's custom Airtable app, but nothing on my own. A growing headache right behind my eyes got the better of me.

**Total coding time today**: 4 hours

**Thoughts**: I'm thinking of moving several variables related to table instances and field names into a separate file and importing it where needed. That would probably be a lot more streamlined than repeating the same lines in several files, especially on the off chance that something might get renamed down the road. Much easier to change one file instead of several.
