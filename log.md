# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made solid headway on two Airtable custom apps:
1. A big one that I'm creating for a client
1. My first custom app that I'm planning on publishing for sale. Spawned by a request from another Airtable user, this app takes an existing Airtable app to a whole new level.

**Thoughts:** When I first started the personal custom app about a year ago, I was still pretty green in React. I'm a lot more comfortable with it now and really enjoy the development process, even when things don't work quite like I expect. There are bits of my original code that I'm able to salvage, but a good chunk of it will likely be scrapped.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately I can't share details about the client app, but I'll see if I can share some screenshots once it's finished. I'll share more about the other app once it's ready to publish.
