# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made solid headway on two Airtable custom apps:
1. A big one that I'm creating for a client
1. My first custom app that I'm planning on publishing for sale. Spawned by a request from another Airtable user, this app takes an existing Airtable app to a whole new level.

**Total coding time today**: 3.5 hours

**Thoughts**: When I first started the personal custom app about a year ago, I was still pretty green in React. I'm a lot more comfortable with it now and really enjoy the development process, even when things don't work quite like I expect. There are bits of my original code that I'm able to salvage, but a good chunk of it will likely be scrapped.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately I can't share details about the client app, but I'll see if I can share some screenshots once it's finished. I'll share more about the other app once it's ready to publish.

### Day 2: February 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Good progress on my client's custom Airtable app, but nothing on my own. A growing headache right behind my eyes got the better of me.

**Total coding time today**: 4 hours

**Thoughts**: I'm thinking of moving several variables related to table instances and field names into a separate file and importing it where needed. That would probably be a lot more streamlined than repeating the same lines in several files, especially on the off chance that something might get renamed down the road. Much easier to change one file instead of several.

### Day 3: February 19, 2022

**Today's progress**: Worked on my custom app. Restructured the code (moved components to their own files, created some utility files, tweaked the data format). Did a quick Git refresher (used it at my last animation job 10 yrs ago and nothing since then). Built a local Git repo, pushed to GitHub, made a GitHub project.

**Total coding time**: 1 hr 15 minutes

**Thoughts**: I'm SO glad that VSCode has built-in Git support. As much as I like coding, I've never been a huge fan of command line tools, which might explain why I never bothered to make repos of my own projects. ðŸ¤£ I've been storing some projects on GitHub as gists, but today is the first time in ages that I made an actual repo and committed some code to it, and it's only because VSCode made it so incredibly easy.

It's fun having little epiphanies now and then about how things can be optimized, and a few of those happened during my short coding stretch today. I wasn't able to act on all of them, but having a project in GitHub for tracking all of the things that I want to do with a given coding endeavor helps immensely. I was originally tracking things in Notion, but GitHub just makes a lot more sense (even more sense than tracking everything in Airtable, which is slightly ironic considering that it's an Airtable app).

### Day 4: February 21, 2022

**Today's progress**: A little work on my client's Airtable app, but not as much as I'd hoped. A video editing project got added to the mix so I'm hopping between HitFilm Pro and VSCode for a little while.

**Total coding time**: 1.5 hrs

**Thoughts**: nothing of note today.

### Day 5: February 22, 2022

**Today's progress**: More work on my client's Airtable app. Hit an odd snag while adding a search feature. It worked up to a point, but then the search field stopped accepting input. No idea why.

**Total coding time**: 2.5 hrs

**Thoughts**: The search feature failing was very frustrating. I even reverted back to older code that was working before the failure, but it didn't change. I wonder if the browser is just being a pill, and things will clear up after a restart. I'll keep my fingers crossed for Thursday when I next work on it.

### Day 6: February 24, 2022

**Today's progress**: More work on my client's Airtable app. The search field issue that I ran into on Tuesday was apparently just a browser hiccup. Working fine now. Made good progress in several parts of the app.

**Total coding time**: 2.5 hrs

**Thoughts**: Nothing today.

### Day 7: February 25, 2022

**Today's progress**: My client asked me to pause work on his app to address more pressing issues, so today it was just a little work on my own app. Added some new stuff, fixed a bug, streamlined some pieces. Feeling good with the progress.

**Total coding time**: 1 hr

**Thoughts**: Nothing today.

### Day 8: February 26, 2022

**Today's progress**: Decided to experiment with React Native today. First test: pull data from Airtable via the REST API and display it in a simple app. Hit some odd snags, but I got it working.

**Total coding time**: 1.75 hrs

**Thoughts**: The interest in React Native came from a client who might be turning over a project from another developer. I've got an idea for a personal app that I want to use as a test to become more familiar with React Native. I might just use the repo that I made for today's test and roll that app concept into it, though I'd prefer to rename it (I used the recommended "Awesome Project" title from the walkthrough).

### On Hold as of late February, 2022

03/22/2022 - It's been a while since I updated this thing, but I figured it's worth documenting why I'm no longer documenting.

Shortly after my last update I had a series of conversations with my longest-running Airtable consulting client that led to him hiring me full-time. Since then my entire schedule has changed. My client-turned-employer is on the east coast (I'm on the west), so I've been starting my days earlier to be a little more in sync with them. Everything is going really well, but once my workday wraps it's difficult to find the energy for personal projects (a problem that I've faced pretty much my whole life). I've been coding almost every day for work projects and a few remaining client jobs, but just not logging it here (or anywhere else) because the logging process now feels like a burden. It's tough to say if/when I'll continue with the formal tracking, but I'm definitely still coding.
